Hello!

My name is **Anton√≠n Wingender**. I'm a software developer, usually working with web frontend technologies. I also like to build my own apps and do some indie hacking.

On this blog, I want to write about my projects or some interesting things I've learned.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me on [email](mailto:me@awingender.com).

Current to-do list:
[ ] Clean up the unnecessary pages and articles
[ ] Add a welcome article post
[ ] Add a project of mine
[ ] Add an actual article about one of my projects
