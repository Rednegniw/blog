## Introduction

Authentication in Svelte 5 is in a weird state right now. Up until recently, the recommended way to do authentication was to use [Lucia](https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia). It is even still included in the official Svelte CLI tool when creating new projects.

Recently however, the creator of Lucia has [publicly announced his intention to deprecate the library](https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia/discussions/1707), stating that he wants to make it a public resource on implementing your auth from scratch.

While implementing your own auth system is a great learning experience, and also, a bit of a bragging right among web developers, sometimes you just want to get something working as quickly as possible.

This is where [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/docs) comes in. It is a modern, easy-to-use authentication system with a lot of providers. With some setup, it is easy to integrate into your Svelte 5 project.

In this article, I want to give you a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Better Auth into your Svelte 5 project.

I am assuming that you have a Svelte 5 project already set up. If not, please follow the [Official Svelte docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/creating-a-project) to create one. Also, I will be using PostgreSQL for this example, but you can use any other database supported by Better Auth.

## 1. Install the libraries

First, as always, we want to install the necessary library.

<PackageInstaller packages="better-auth" />

<span class="hidden">better-auth</span>

## 2. Set up the environment variables

Open (or create) the `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```powershell
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=[your-secret-key]
BETTER_AUTH_URL=[your-better-auth-url]
```

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: This secret key is used to sign the JWT token and generate hashes. Treat it as a password - use a random, sufficiently long string of characters for it. If someone gains access to it, they will be able to impersonate your users.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: This is the URL of your Better Auth instance. Set it to the URL of your Svelte 5 project. On localhost, it is usually `http://localhost:5173`.

## 3. Create the `auth.ts` file

Create a new file in the `src/lib` directory called `auth.ts`.

```ts title="src/lib/auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_URL } from "$env/static/private";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  secret: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  url: BETTER_AUTH_URL,
});
```

## 4. Set up the database and the schema

If you don't already have a database, set it up. Better Auth supports various databases,
such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, or MongoDB.

For this example, I have chosen to use PostgreSQL. If you want to use a different database, please refer to the [Better Auth docs, such as this one for MySQL](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/adapters/mysql).

### 4.1. Create the database

The easiest way to create a local PostgreSQL database is to use Docker.

```powershell
docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

This will create a new container named `my-postgres` with the password `mysecretpassword` and map port `5432` to the host.

### 4.2. Add the database provider to the `auth.ts` file

Now that we have a database, we can add the database provider to the `auth.ts` file. This is important, as the CLI tool will look for the database provider in the `auth.ts` file. Depending on the database you are using, you will need to install different packages. For PostgreSQL, you will need to install `pg`.

```ts title="src/lib/auth.ts"
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, BETTER_AUTH_URL } from "$env/static/private";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  secret: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  url: BETTER_AUTH_URL,

  /**
   * For other databases, check the Better Auth docs.
   */
  database: new Pool({
    connectionString:
      "postgres://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres",
  }),
});
```

### 4.3. Set up the necessary auth schema

Now that we have a database, we can set up the schema. Better Auth requires the following tables to be present in the database:

- `user`
- `session`
- `account`
- `verification`

You can see the schema in detail in the [Better Auth docs](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#core-schema).

Fortunately, Better Auth comes with a CLI tool that can create the schema for you.

```powershell
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

You should see the following output:

<Image
  class="rounded-xl bg-black p-2 py-3"
  src={generateCommandOutput}
  alt="Generate command output"
/>

This will create an SQL schema in the `./better-auth_migrations` directory. You can then apply a migration to actually put the schema into your database:

```powershell
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

You should see the following output:

<Image
  class="rounded-xl bg-black p-2 py-3"
  src={migrateCommandOutput}
  alt="Migrate command output"
/>

And voilà! Your database is now set up and ready to use.

## 5. Connect it with SvelteKit

Now, in order for Better Auth to work with SvelteKit server, we need to add a hook to the `hooks.server.ts` file.

```ts title="src/hooks.server.ts"
import { auth } from "$lib/auth";
import { svelteKitHandler } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";

export const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  return svelteKitHandler(event, resolve, auth);
};
```

In order to create an instance to use on the client, we need to create a new file in the `src/lib` directory called `auth-client.ts`.

```ts title="src/lib/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/svelte";

export const authClient = createAuthClient();
```

## 6. Choose a provider and add it to the `auth.ts` file

Better Auth comes with a lot of providers. Providers are services that allow users to sign in to your application. I'm sure you've seen a "Sign in with Google" button somewhere on the internet. That's a provider. Many modern websites use only providers, but the standard way, username/password, is also supported.

For this example, I will be showing you the Google provider.

For the Google provider, we will need to get two environment variables for Better Auth to work.

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can get these from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

In the Google Cloud Console > Credentials > Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

Once you have the credentials, add them to the `.env` file:

```powershell title=".env"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[your-google-client-id]
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[your-google-client-secret]
```

Now, you need to add the necessary variables to the `auth.ts` file, in order for Better Auth to use them in the Google provider.

```ts title="src/lib/auth.ts"
import { googleProvider } from "better-auth/providers/google";
import {
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  BETTER_AUTH_URL,
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
} from "$env/static/private";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  secret: BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
  url: BETTER_AUTH_URL,

  // Authentication providers
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    },
  },
});
```

Remember the `auth-client.ts` file? We can take the auth client from there and use it to sign in with Google. Ordinarily, this would be attached to some sort of button. Go to your `src/routes/index.svelte` file and add the following code:

```svelte title="src/routes/index.svelte"
<script>
  import { authClient } from "$lib/auth-client";

  const signIn = async () => {
    await authClient.signIn.social({
      provider: "google",
      /**
       * You should set this to where you want your user to land as they sign in.
       */
      callbackURL: "/dashboard",

      /**
       * This is the URL that will be used to create a new user.
       * If you don't set this, the user will be redirected to the callbackURL.
       */
      newUserCallbackURL: "/dashboard",
    });
  };
</script>

<button on:click={signIn}>Sign in with Google</button>
```

If you set it up correctly, you should:

- be redirected to the Google sign-in flow
- after completing the flow, be redirected to the `/dashboard` route
- see a new user in your database

Now you can sign in with Google! Better Auth takes care of creating a new user in the database, and also, if the user already exists, it reuses it. It also creates a session for the user, which is used to keep the user logged in.

Now, we will actually set up an authenticated route.

## 7. Tying it all together

Usually, you will have some sort of part of your application that is protected as a whole, like a dashboard for your user. For this dashboard, we want to check if the user is authenticated every time they try to access any part of it.

In SvelteKit, you have the concept of [layouts](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/routing#layout). Layouts are a way to wrap your pages in a common layout, perfectly suited for this use case.

The thing is, if we just created a `routes/auth` directory, the path for any page under it would be `/auth/...`. This is not what we want. We want the layout load function to be able to check it for all of them, but not have the `/auth` prefix in the URL.

To achieve this, we can create a [layout group](<https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/advanced-routing#Advanced-layouts-(group)>). This way, we can create layouts for all of the pages under the `(auth)` directory, but not have the `/auth` prefix in the URL.

Enough talking, let's create the authenticated layout. Create a new file in the `src/routes/(auth)` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist) called `+layout.server.ts`.

```ts title="src/routes/(auth)/+layout.server.ts"
import type { LayoutServerLoad } from "./$types";
import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";
import { auth } from "$lib/auth";

/**
 * Layout server load function
 *
 * This function checks if the user is authenticated.
 * If not, it redirects to the login page.
 */
export const load: LayoutServerLoad = async ({ request }) => {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: request.headers,
  });

  /**
   * This is the important part.
   * If the user is not authenticated, redirect to the login page.
   */
  if (!session) {
    throw redirect(302, "/login");
  }

  /**
   * If the user is authenticated, let them through, and add the user to the page data.
   */
  return {
    user: session.user,
  };
};
```

Now, create a new page under the `(auth)` directory called `/dashboard/+page.svelte`. On any page under the `(auth)` directory, you can access the user from the page data.

```svelte title="src/routes/(auth)/dashboard/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	import type { PageData } from './$types';

	const { user } = page.data as PageData
</script>

<div>
	{#if user}
		<p>{user.email}</p>
	{/if}
</div>
```

Now, you should be able to achieve the following:

- Click the "Sign in with Google" button
- Be redirected to the Google sign-in flow
- After completing the flow, be redirected to the `/dashboard` route
- See the user's email on the page

## 8. Log out

Now for the final part. We want to be able to log out. We will add a button to the `dashboard/+page.svelte` file.

```svelte title="src/routes/(auth)/dashboard/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { goto } from "$app/navigation";
  import { signOut } from "$lib/auth-client";
  import { page } from "$app/state";
  import type { PageData } from "./$types";

	const { user } = page.data as PageData

  const onLogout = signOut({
		fetchOptions: {
			onSuccess: () => goto('/')
		}
	});
</script>

<div>
	{#if user}
		<p>{user.email}</p>
	{/if}
</div>

<button on:click={onLogout}>Log out</button>
```

Now, clicking the logout button should log you out and redirect you to the home page. Now, if you try to access the `/dashboard` route, you shouldn't be able to.

## 9. Conclusion

And that's it! You now have a fully working authentication system in your Svelte 5 project. That wasn't so hard, was it?
