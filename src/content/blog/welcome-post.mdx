Hi, and welcome to my blog! This post is a quick introduction to my blog, why I'm writing it and what I'll be writing about.

## Who am I?

I'm Antonín, a software developer from the Czech Republic. Currently, I'm working a full-time job as a web developer, but I'm very interested in building my own apps and technology topics in general.

## What I'll be writing about

Broadly, I would like to structure this blog around two core themes:

1. **Building my own apps**: I want to create apps in public, sharing my learnings and experiences and providing updates on them to anyone who's interested. I don't only want to write about the technology and code, but also about the process of architecting, designing, and releasing them. I'm obviously not an expert on many of these topics, particularly the ones not related to coding, but I'm hoping to improve along the way.

2. **Coding and technology topics**: Whenever I come across something interesting that catches my eye—a new framework, library, or something else—I'll write about it here. Expect deep dives and tutorials that will hopefully provide some value and insight into your own coding.

## Why have I created this blog?

I've never written about my work in a structured way before, so please bear with me while I figure this out.

Broadly, I did it for a few reasons:

1. **To improve my writing skills**: I've always wanted to improve my writing skills, and I think writing about my own work and experiences is a great way to do that.

2. **To share my work**: I want to create apps in public, sharing my learnings and experiences and providing updates on them to anyone who's interested. Not only do I think it's a good way to get feedback and increase exposure for my work, but it also motivates me to keep working on it as a sort of soft accountability.

3. **To get out of my comfort zone**: As I am not a very good writer and am not used to sharing my thoughts publicly, I hope writing this blog will help me improve in those regards.

## What's next?

As a first post, I want to write about my small side project, [Faviconizer](https://www.faviconizer.com). It's a simple tool that allows you to create a favicon for your website. I'll be writing about the process of building it, the challenges I faced, and the lessons I learned.

After that, I want to create a multi-part series on a bigger, more serious app project that I am working on, sharing the progress and the tribulations there.

I'm also open to suggestions, so if you have any ideas or topics you'd like to see, please let me know at [me@awingender.com](mailto:me@awingender.com).

Thanks for reading!
